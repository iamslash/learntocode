[All People Report to the Given Manager](https://leetcode.com/problems/all-people-report-to-the-given-manager/)

# Idea

* Tables

```
Table: Employees

+---------------+---------+
| Column Name   | Type    |
+---------------+---------+
| employee_id   | int     |
| employee_name | varchar |
| manager_id    | int     |
+---------------+---------+
employee_id is the primary key for this table.
Each row of this table indicates that the employee with ID employee_id and name employee_name reports his work to his/her direct manager with manager_id
The head of the company is the employee with employee_id = 1.
```

* Examples

```
Employees table:
+-------------+---------------+------------+
| employee_id | employee_name | manager_id |
+-------------+---------------+------------+
| 1           | Boss          | 1          |
| 3           | Alice         | 3          |
| 2           | Bob           | 1          |
| 4           | Daniel        | 2          |
| 7           | Luis          | 4          |
| 8           | Jhon          | 3          |
| 9           | Angela        | 8          |
| 77          | Robert        | 1          |
+-------------+---------------+------------+

Result table:
+-------------+
| employee_id |
+-------------+
| 2           |
| 77          |
| 4           |
| 7           |
+-------------+

The head of the company is the employee with employee_id 1.
The employees with employee_id 2 and 77 report their work directly to the head of the company.
The employee with employee_id 4 report his work indirectly to the head of the company 4 --> 2 --> 1. 
The employee with employee_id 7 report his work indirectly to the head of the company 7 --> 4 --> 2 --> 1.
The employees with employee_id 3, 8 and 9 don't report their work to head of company directly or indirectly. 
```

Let's use Join.

```
1 Boss   1 | 1 Boss  1 | 1 Boss  1
3 Alice  3 | 3 Alice 3 | 3 Alice 3
2 Bob    1 | 1 Boss  1 | 1 Boss  1
4 Danial 2 | 2 Bob   1 | 1 Boss  1
...
```

# Implementation

```sql
SELECT e1.employee_id
FROM Employees e1 
JOIN Employees e2 ON e1.manager_id = e2.employee_id
JOIN Employees e3 ON e2.manager_id = e3.employee_id
WHERE e3.manager_id = 1 AND e1.employee_id != e1.manager_id
```
