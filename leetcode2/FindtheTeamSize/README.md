Employee Table:
+-------------+------------+
| employee_id | team_id    |
+-------------+------------+
|     1       |     8      |
|     2       |     8      |
|     3       |     8      |
|     4       |     7      |
|     5       |     9      |
|     6       |     9      |

Result table:
+-------------+------------+
| employee_id | team_size  |
+-------------+------------+
|     1       |     3      |
|     2       |     3      |

|     5       |     2      |
|     6       |     2      |

Employees with Id 1,2,3 are part of a team with team_id = 8.
Employees with Id 4 is part of a team with team_id = 7.
Employees with Id 5,6 are part of a team with team_id = 9.

SELECT a.employee_id, COUNT(b.employee_id) AS team_size
FROM Employee a
JOIN Employee b 
  ON a.team_id = b.team_id
GROUP BY a.employee_id
