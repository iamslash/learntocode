+----------+------------+-------------+------------+

Products
+------------+--------------+-------+
| product_id | product_name | price |
+------------+--------------+-------+
| 1          | keyboard     | 120   |
| 2          | mouse        | 80    |
| 3          | screen       | 600   |
| 4          | hard disk    | 450   |
+------------+--------------+-------+

Result table:
+--------------+------------+----------+------------+
| product_name | product_id | order_id | order_date |
+--------------+------------+----------+------------+
| keyboard     | 1          | 6        | 2020-08-01 |
| keyboard     | 1          | 7        | 2020-08-01 |
| mouse        | 2          | 8        | 2020-08-03 |
| screen       | 3          | 3        | 2020-08-29 |
+--------------+------------+----------+------------+
keyboard's most recent order is in 2020-08-01, it was ordered two times this day.
mouse's most recent order is in 2020-08-03, it was ordered only once this day.
screen's most recent order is in 2020-08-29, it was ordered only once this day.
The hard disk was never ordered and we don't include it in the result table.

# Implementation

```sql
-- 1977ms 86.62% 0B 100.00%
SELECT p.product_name, o.product_id, o.order_id, o.order_date
FROM Orders o 
JOIN Products p
  ON o.product_id = p.product_id
WHERE (p.product_id, o.order_date) 
   IN (SELECT product_id, MAX(order_date) AS order_ate
         FROM Orders
        GROUP BY product_id)
ORDER BY p.product_name ASC, o.product_id ASC, o.order_id ASC 
```
