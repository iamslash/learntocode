Users table:
+------+-----------+
| id   | name      |
+------+-----------+
| 1    | Alice     |
| 2    | Bob       |
| 3    | Alex      |
| 4    | Donald    |
| 7    | Lee       |
| 13   | Jonathan  |
| 19   | Elvis     |
+------+-----------+

Rides table:
+------+----------+----------+
| id   | user_id  | distance |
+------+----------+----------+
| 1    | 1        | 120      |
| 2    | 2        | 317      |
| 3    | 3        | 222      |
| 4    | 7        | 100      |

| 9    | 7        | 230      |
+------+----------+----------+

Result table:
+----------+--------------------+
| name     | travelled_distance |
+----------+--------------------+
| Elvis    | 450                |
| Lee      | 450                |
| Bob      | 317                |
| Jonathan | 312                |
| Alex     | 222                |
| Alice    | 120                |
| Donald   | 0                  |
+----------+--------------------+
Elvis and Lee travelled 450 miles, Elvis is the top traveller as his name is alphabetically smaller than Lee.
Bob, Jonathan, Alex and Alice have only one ride and we just order them by the total distances of the ride.
Donald didn't have any rides, the distance travelled by him is 0.

# Implementation

```sql
-- 857ms 45.42% 0B 100.00%
SELECT u.name AS name, SUM(IF(r.distance,r.distance,0)) AS travelled_distance
FROM Users u
LEFT JOIN Rides r
  ON u.id = r.user_id
GROUP BY u.id
ORDER BY travelled_distance DESC, name ASC```
