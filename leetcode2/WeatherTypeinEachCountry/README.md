| 2          | 15            | 2019-11-01 |

| 7          | 22            | 2019-12-01 |
| 7          | 20            | 2019-12-02 |

+------------+---------------+------------+
Result table:
+--------------+--------------+
| country_name | weather_type |
+--------------+--------------+
| USA          | Cold         |
| Austraila    | Cold         |
| Peru         | Hot          |
| China        | Warm         |
| Morocco      | Hot          |
+--------------+--------------+
Average weather_state in USA in November is (15) / 1 = 15 so weather type is Cold.
Average weather_state in Austraila in November is (-2 + 0 + 3) / 3 = 0.333 so weather type is Cold.
Average weather_state in Peru in November is (25) / 1 = 25 so weather type is Hot.
Average weather_state in China in November is (16 + 18 + 21) / 3 = 18.333 so weather type is Warm.
Average weather_state in Morocco in November is (25 + 27 + 31) / 3 = 27.667 so weather type is Hot.
We know nothing about average weather_state in Spain in November so we don't include it in the result table.

# Implementation

```sql
-- 1114ms 14.07% 0B 100.00%
SELECT a.country_name, 
  CASE 
    WHEN AVG(weather_state) <= 15 
      THEN "Cold"
    WHEN AVG(weather_state) >= 25 
      THEN "Hot"
    ELSE
      "Warm"
  END AS weather_type 
FROM Countries AS a
JOIN Weather AS b
  ON a.country_id = b.country_id
WHERE b.day BETWEEN "2019-11-01" AND "2019-11-30"
GROUP BY a.country_id
