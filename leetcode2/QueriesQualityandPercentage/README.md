[Queries Quality and Percentage](https://leetcode.com/problems/queries-quality-and-percentage/)

# Idea

```
SQL Schema
Table: Queries

+-------------+---------+
| Column Name | Type    |
+-------------+---------+
| query_name  | varchar |
| result      | varchar |
| position    | int     |
| rating      | int     |
+-------------+---------+
There is no primary key for this table, it may have duplicate rows.
This table contains information collected from some queries on a database.
The position column has a value from 1 to 500.
The rating column has a value from 1 to 5. Query with rating less than 3 is a poor query.

Queries table:
+------------+-------------------+----------+--------+
| query_name | result            | position | rating |
+------------+-------------------+----------+--------+
| Dog        | Golden Retriever  | 1        | 5      |
| Dog        | German Shepherd   | 2        | 5      |
| Dog        | Mule              | 200      | 1      |
| Cat        | Shirazi           | 5        | 2      |
| Cat        | Siamese           | 3        | 3      |
| Cat        | Sphynx            | 7        | 4      |
+------------+-------------------+----------+--------+

Result table:
+------------+---------+-----------------------+
| query_name | quality | poor_query_percentage |
+------------+---------+-----------------------+
| Dog        | 2.50    | 33.33                 |
| Cat        | 0.66    | 33.33                 |
+------------+---------+-----------------------+

Dog queries quality is ((5 / 1) + (5 / 2) + (1 / 200)) / 3 = 2.50
Dog queries poor_ query_percentage is (1 / 3) * 100 = 33.33

Cat queries quality equals ((2 / 5) + (3 / 3) + (4 / 7)) / 3 = 0.66
Cat queries poor_ query_percentage is (1 / 3) * 100 = 33.33
```

# Implementation

```sql
-- 742ms 32.84% 0B 100.00%
SELECT 
  query_name, 
  ROUND(AVG(rating/position),2) AS quality,
  ROUND(AVG(rating < 3) * 100,2) AS poor_query_percentage
FROM
  Queries
GROUP BY query_name;  
```
