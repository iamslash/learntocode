# Idea

Schema:

```
Table: Friendship

+---------------+---------+
| Column Name   | Type    |
+---------------+---------+
| user1_id      | int     |
| user2_id      | int     |
+---------------+---------+
(user1_id, user2_id) is the primary key for this table.
Each row of this table indicates that there is a friendship relation between user1_id and user2_id.
Table: Likes

+-------------+---------+
| Column Name | Type    |
+-------------+---------+
| user_id     | int     |
| page_id     | int     |
+-------------+---------+
(user_id, page_id) is the primary key for this table.
Each row of this table indicates that user_id likes page_id.
```

Examples:

```
Friendship table:
+----------+----------+
| user1_id | user2_id |
+----------+----------+
| 1        | 2        |
| 1        | 3        |
| 1        | 4        |
| 2        | 3        |
| 2        | 4        |
| 2        | 5        |
| 6        | 1        |
+----------+----------+
 
Likes table:
+---------+---------+
| user_id | page_id |
+---------+---------+
| 1       | 88      |
| 2       | 23      |
| 3       | 24      |
| 4       | 56      |
| 5       | 11      |
| 6       | 33      |
| 2       | 77      |
| 3       | 77      |
| 6       | 88      |
+---------+---------+

Result table:
+------------------+
| recommended_page |
+------------------+
| 23               |
| 24               |
| 56               |
| 33               |
| 77               |
+------------------+
User one is friend with users 2, 3, 4 and 6.
Suggested pages are 23 from user 2, 24 from user 3, 56 from user 3 and 33 from user 6.
Page 77 is suggested from both user 2 and user 3.
Page 88 is not suggested because user 1 already likes it.
```

# Implementation

```sql
-- 245ms 82.63% 0B 100.00%
SELECT DISTINCT page_id AS recommended_page 
FROM Likes
WHERE user_id IN (
  SELECT user2_id AS friend_id FROM Friendship WHERE user1_id = 1
  UNION
  SELECT user1_id AS friend_id FROM Friendship WHERE user2_id = 1)
  AND
  page_id NOT IN (SELECT page_id FROM Likes WHERE user_id = 1)
```
