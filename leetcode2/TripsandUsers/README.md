* Examples

```
+------------+-------------------+
|     Day    | Cancellation Rate |
+------------+-------------------+
| 2013-10-01 |       0.33        |

| 2013-10-03 |       0.50        |
+------------+-------------------+
```

# Implementation

```sql
-- 197ms 88.02% 0B 100.00%
SELECT Request_at AS Day, 
       ROUND(COUNT(IF(Status != 'completed', TRUE, NULL)) / COUNT(*), 2) AS 'Cancellation Rate'
FROM Trips
WHERE Client_Id NOT IN (SELECT Users_Id FROM Users WHERE Banned = 'Yes') 
       AND (Request_at BETWEEN '2013-10-01' AND '2013-10-03')
GROUP BY Request_at;
```
