[Minimum Difficulty of a Job Schedule](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-difficulty-of-a-job-schedule/)

Given job difficulties `J[]` and day `d`, you can seperate `J[]` with
`d` groups. You have to finish at least one task every day. And The
difficulty of a day is the maximum difficulty of a job difficulty in
that day. Find the minimum difficulty of a job schedule.

# Recursive way

## Idea

This is very similar with [Palindrome PartitioningIII](https://github.com/iamslash/learntocode/blob/master/leetcode2/PalindromePartitioningIII/README.md).

## Implementation

* [c++11](a.cpp)

## Complexity

```
O(DN^2) O(N^2)
```

# Iterative way

## Idea

???

## Implementation

* [c++11](a.cpp)

## Complexity

```
O(N^2) O(N)
```
