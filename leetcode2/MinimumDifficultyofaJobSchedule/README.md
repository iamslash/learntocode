# Recursive Dynamic Programming

## Idea

This is very similar with [Palindrome
PartitioningIII](/leetcode2/PalindromePartitioningIII/README.md).

## Implementation

* [c++11](a.cpp)

## Complexity

```
O(DN^2) O(N^2)
```

# Iterative Dynamic Programming

## Idea

???

## Implementation

* [c++11](a.cpp)
* [java8](MainApp.java)

## Complexity

```
O(N^2) O(N)
```
