# Example

```
Actions table:
+---------+---------+-------------+--------+--------+
| user_id | post_id | action_date | action | extra  |
+---------+---------+-------------+--------+--------+
| 1       | 1       | 2019-07-01  | view   | null   |
| 1       | 1       | 2019-07-01  | like   | null   |
| 1       | 1       | 2019-07-01  | share  | null   |
| 2       | 2       | 2019-07-04  | view   | null   |
| 2       | 2       | 2019-07-04  | report | spam   |
| 3       | 4       | 2019-07-04  | view   | null   |
| 3       | 4       | 2019-07-04  | report | spam   |
| 4       | 3       | 2019-07-02  | view   | null   |
| 4       | 3       | 2019-07-02  | report | spam   |
| 5       | 2       | 2019-07-03  | view   | null   |
| 5       | 2       | 2019-07-03  | report | racism |
| 5       | 5       | 2019-07-03  | view   | null   |
| 5       | 5       | 2019-07-03  | report | racism |
+---------+---------+-------------+--------+--------+

Removals table:
+---------+-------------+
| post_id | remove_date |
+---------+-------------+
| 2       | 2019-07-20  |
| 3       | 2019-07-18  |
+---------+-------------+

Result table:
+-----------------------+
| average_daily_percent |
+-----------------------+
| 75.00                 |
+-----------------------+
The percentage for 2019-07-04 is 50% because only one post of two spam reported posts was removed.
The percentage for 2019-07-02 is 100% because one post was reported as spam and it was removed.
The other days had no spam reports so the average is (50 + 100) / 2 = 75%
Note that the output is only one number and that we do not care about the remove dates.
```

# Idea

날짜별로 등록된 글에서 action 이 `report` 이고 extra 가 `spam` 인 것들 중 실제로 제거된 것들의 비율을 구하는 문제이다.

# Implementation

```sql
-- 574ms 64.22%

SELECT 
  ROUND(AVG(ratio*100), 2) average_daily_percent
FROM
  (SELECT
    COUNT(DISTINCT(R.post_id)) / COUNT(DISTINCT(A.post_id)) AS ratio
  FROM
    Actions A
  LEFT JOIN 
    Removals R
  ON
    A.post_id = R.post_id  
  WHERE A.extra = 'spam'
  GROUP BY A.action_date) T
;
```
