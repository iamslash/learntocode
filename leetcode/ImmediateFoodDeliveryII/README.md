[Immediate Food Delivery II](https://leetcode.com/problems/immediate-food-delivery-ii/)

# Idea

```
Table: Delivery

+-----------------------------+---------+
| Column Name                 | Type    |
+-----------------------------+---------+
| delivery_id                 | int     |
| customer_id                 | int     |
| order_date                  | date    |
| customer_pref_delivery_date | date    |
+-----------------------------+---------+

delivery_id is the primary key of this table.  The table holds
information about food delivery to customers that make orders at some
date and specify a preferred delivery date (on the same order date or
after it).

Delivery table:
+-------------+-------------+------------+-----------------------------+
| delivery_id | customer_id | order_date | customer_pref_delivery_date |
+-------------+-------------+------------+-----------------------------+
| 1           | 1           | 2019-08-01 | 2019-08-02                  |
| 2           | 2           | 2019-08-02 | 2019-08-02                  |
| 3           | 1           | 2019-08-11 | 2019-08-12                  |
| 4           | 3           | 2019-08-24 | 2019-08-24                  |
| 5           | 3           | 2019-08-21 | 2019-08-22                  |
| 6           | 2           | 2019-08-11 | 2019-08-13                  |
| 7           | 4           | 2019-08-09 | 2019-08-09                  |
+-------------+-------------+------------+-----------------------------+

Result table:
+----------------------+
| immediate_percentage |
+----------------------+
| 50.00                |
+----------------------+

The customer id 1 has a first order with delivery id 1 and it is scheduled.
The customer id 2 has a first order with delivery id 2 and it is immediate.
The customer id 3 has a first order with delivery id 5 and it is scheduled.
The customer id 4 has a first order with delivery id 7 and it is immediate.
Hence, half the customers have immediate first orders.
``` 



# Implementation

```sql
-- 302ms 52.21%
SELECT ROUND(100 * SUM(order_date = customer_pref_delivery_date) / 
  COUNT(order_date), 2) AS immediate_percentage
FROM Delivery
WHERE (customer_id, order_date) IN (
  SELECT customer_id, MIN(order_date)
  FROM Delivery
  GROUP BY customer_id);
```
